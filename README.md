# Call Claude API
A minimal custom Slack Workflow Builder function that calls the Anthropic [Create a Message](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages) API.
⚠️ This only works with the 1st party API - there's no built-in support for Bedrock nor Vertex

This is not an official tool - the use of the official Claude logo is just for findability.

Run `slack env add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` `YOUR API KEY` to add your Anthropic API key.
